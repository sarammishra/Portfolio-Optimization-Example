# Portfolio-Optimization-Example
An Example of a fully deployed portfolio optimization tool (built in collaboration with Joseph Vanderstelt) 

This is an example of a full stack R-Shiny application. The goal of the optimization tool is to look at various kinds of securities within any hypothetical portfolio 
and pick a combination of securities which provide the highest total return across various interest rate scenarios.
